### _A Distributed File System implemented in Go_

- A robust distributed file system from scratch using Go, leveraging peer-to-peer technology to facilitate direct communication and data sharing among nodes.
- Implemented content addressable storage (CAS) to enable efficient data retrieval and storage based on unique content hashes, ensuring data integrity and reducing redundancy across the network.
- Utilized network programming to establish reliable communication protocols for performing CRUD operations, optimizing data transfer and synchronization between peers in the distributed environment.
